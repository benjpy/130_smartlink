According to TechCrunch’s article, “SunGreenH2’s nano-scale engineering could double green hydrogen production”, SunGreenH2 (HAX 2020) has raised a $2 million seed round. The funding round—led by SGInnovate with support from SOSV’s HAX, Vinci BV, Cap Vista, Entrepreneur First, she1K, and Apsara Investments—will be used to set up SunGreenH2’s first manufacturing facilities in Melbourne.
SunGreenH2 is taking a nanotech-level approach to green hydrogen development, focusing on electrolysis to scale hydrogen made directly from water.
Explaining how SunGreenH2 doubles hydrogen production while lowering cost and reliance on rare elements, the company’s CEO and co-founder Tulika Raj told TechCrunch, “We are nanostructuring a proprietary alloy-based cathode that doubles the surface area available for the reaction.” She added, “That doubles the amount of hydrogen produced right there. But that’s not enough, you need to to be scalable and manufacturable. So it doesn’t use precious metals—in this case we are reducing the amount needed by 30x.”
SunGreenH2 went through SOSV’s HAX program in Shenzhen in 2020.
