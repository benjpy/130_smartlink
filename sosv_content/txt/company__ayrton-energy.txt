Ayrton Energy’s mission is to provide energy security fueled by hydrogen.
Ayrton’s proprietary technology enables hydrogen to be stored within an organic liquid, which can be handled and transported no differently than gasoline. This straightforward storage approach enables hydrogen to be used as a power generating fuel to meet energy needs above grid capacity or in the case of power outage and enables hydrogen to be a viable replacement for diesel generators and lithium-ion batteries, further reducing grid pressure and providing a path for net-zero energy.
