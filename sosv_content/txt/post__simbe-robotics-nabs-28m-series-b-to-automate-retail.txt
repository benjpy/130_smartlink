Simbe Robotics (HAX) raised $28M in Series B funding, led by Eclipse, to expand its mission to revolutionize the retail industry through automation and AI.
Simbe is the category leader in retail automation solutions, combining cutting-edge AI and robotics in a single platform that empowers retailers to protect profitability and enhance business operations. The company’s comprehensive business intelligence solution is powered by Tally, the world’s first fully autonomous in-store product auditing solution that traverses aisles to generate exact product location data and identify out-of-stock, misplaced, or mispriced products at more than 99% accuracy. The platform transforms retail operations through proprietary AI, computer vision, RFID, and edge computing technology that delivers greater visibility, more accurate data, and real-time insights — creating a better experience for shoppers and store teams alike.
In 2023, Simbe developed new capabilities specifically tailored to the warehouse club format to prepare Tally for chainwide deployment across BJ’s Wholesale Club locations, further validating that Simbe’s solution can seamlessly integrate into any retail environment. In addition to partnering with BJ’s Wholesale, Simbe has signed new agreements and expansions with leading retailers, such as Schnuck Markets, SpartanNash, Wakefern, Carrefour, and more.
Simbe will use the funds to accelerate global expansion and product innovation.
