SOSV portfolio company and current participant in the IndieBio startup development program, OrganBio has emerged from stealth with $2 million in seed funding to transform how human cells and organoids are designed and produced. The round was led by First Star Ventures, with participation from IndieBio, Cape Fear BioCapital, 2ndF, Terasaki Institute, and Alix Ventures.
iOrganBio’s proprietary CellForge™ platform combines AI-driven prediction with high-throughput experimental control to engineer cells and organoids across multiple high-value areas spanning drug discovery, manufacturing, and cell therapies.
The first-of-its-kind platform utilizes closed-loop control of 3D culture environments to dynamically optimize culture conditions during human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation. By changing the way human cells are engineered and deployed across applications, iOrganBio enables predictable, reproducible, and scalable outcomes across a wide range of cell types originating from stem cells and peripheral blood cells. The unique approach could help biopharma partners accelerate disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and drug development.
