HAX’s eldercare robotics startup Labrador Systems (HAX 2019) made waves at CES as it demonstrated new features of its Labrador Retriever robot, designed to extend the impact of caregivers and empower people to live more independently. Labrador showcased a proof-of-concept featuring Amazon’s Echo Show 10, which will be installed on top of the Labrador Retriever.
TechCrunch featured the expanded functionality in an article that highlighted the synergies between Labrador’s technology and Amazon’s voice computing capabilities.
Labrador Systems harnesses the sensors, processors, and algorithms from autonomous vehicles and augmented reality to develop assistive robots for elderly and disabled people. Labrador allows users to create a customized map of their home with routes and “bus stops.” Once a user issues a command via a mobile app, a voice-activated device, a Bluetooth wireless button, or a pre-set schedule, the robot can navigate the home using advanced 3D vision. In late 2022, the California-based company announced backing from the Alexa Fund, which unfolded into compatibility with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistance.
Labrador’s CES demo this week showed off how the Echo Show 10—a device with a smart screen mounted atop a robot—can act as a teleconferencing tablet. With Echo’s built-in swivel (for the screen to face a user upon command) and the voice assist technology, a user can ask the robot to move essential items and bring them within reach.
“The proof-of-concept demo with the Echo Show 10 is a preview of what we will be testing in our next rounds of pilots with care providers,” Labrador CEO Mike Dooley said. “Capabilities like this can make a dramatic difference in the quality of people’s lives and their ability to live independently while staying connected with others, and we’re grateful to Amazon’s team for their support on this project.”
