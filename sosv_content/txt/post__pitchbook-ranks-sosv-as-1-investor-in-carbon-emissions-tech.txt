PitchBook’s Q4 Carbon & Emissions Tech Report features SOSV as the top VC in the space by deal count since 2018.
Per the report, the broader carbon tech space saw record investment in 2022, perhaps spurred by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US and the launch of four programs aiming to “help accelerate private-sector investment, spur advancements in monitoring and reporting practices for carbon management technologies, and provide grants to state and local governments to procure and use products developed from captured carbon emissions.”
The report names biopolymers as an emerging opportunity and features SOSV portfolio company MycoWorks (mycelium-based bio-leather) and its $65M Series C2 in October 2022 as a standout.
