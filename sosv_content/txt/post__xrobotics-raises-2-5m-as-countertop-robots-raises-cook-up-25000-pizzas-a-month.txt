In the fast-paced world of food service, speed and consistency can make or break a business. That’s why XRobotics believes it’s cracked the code on how to bring robotics into everyday restaurants – starting with pizza. And they’ve just announced a $2.5 million seed round led by FinSight Ventures with participation from SOSV, MANA Ventures, and Republic Capital.
The San Francisco-based company has built a compact countertop robot called the xPizza Cube. About the size of a stackable washing machine, the device uses ML to apply sauce, cheese, and pepperoni to pizza dough with speed and precision. It can crank out up to 100 pizzas per hour and adapt to a variety of styles, including Chicago deep dish and Detroit square.
The economics are compelling: the machine leases for $1,300/month over three years and retrofits into existing kitchens, making it accessible to national chains as well as mom and pop shop owners.
“This saves almost 70, sometimes 80% of the time for the staff,” says co-founder and CEO Denis Rodionov. “It is just repeatable work. If you have a pepperoni pizza, you need to place 50 slices of pepperoni one by one.” The robot does that for you, perfectly, every time.
