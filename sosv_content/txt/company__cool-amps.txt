Cool Amps has developed a novel, low energy process for battery recycling that allows recycling to be carried out in a localized fashion, making it far more economical than current process that rely on centralization and collection of black mass. Their process allows for recovery of all the battery components, including directly yielding usable cathode active material, and works with multiple battery chemistries (NMC, LFP, etc.).
