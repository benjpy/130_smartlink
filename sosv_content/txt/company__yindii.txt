Our food system is broken: 1/3 of the food that we produce goes to waste. For restaurants, up to 14% of their sales end up in the trash every day. Yindii fights against food waste by helping restaurants and retailers cut losses and increase revenue by selling unsold food to consumers through its mobile app. Through Yindii, people can now buy high-quality food in excess at up to 80% discount.
