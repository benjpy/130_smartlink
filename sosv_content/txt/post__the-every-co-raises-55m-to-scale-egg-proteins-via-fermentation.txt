The EVERY Company, a pioneer in precision fermentation and SOSV portfolio company, has announced the first close of its $55 million Series D round, coinciding with the U.S. rollout of its products at Walmart. The news, first reported by AgFunderNews, marks a major milestone for one of the earliest, and now most commercially advanced, players in the alternative protein space.
The round was led by McWin Capital Partners, with participation from Main Sequence, Bloom8, TO.VC, Minerva Foods, Grosvenor Food & AgTech, New Agrarian, and SOSV. The new capital will fuel manufacturing expansion and accelerate EVERY’s march toward profitability as they now are selling metric tons of product at scale to some of the biggest food companies in the world.
While EVERY’s animal-free egg proteins resonate with sustainability advocates, founder and CEO Arturo Elizondo says the strongest demand is coming from food manufacturers seeking supply chain resilience. Recurring avian flu outbreaks, price volatility, and salmonella risks have made conventional eggs a growing liability.
EVERY’s shelf-stable powdered protein, which boasts an 18-month shelf life, eliminates the refrigeration and spoilage issues of liquid eggs, often at cost parity or even savings for industrial buyers. In a sector where many alternative protein startups have faltered, EVERY stands out as a case study in scaling with discipline. By solving real economic and logistical pain points (not just ethical or environmental ones) the company is demonstrating that precision fermentation can deliver mass-market economics. As it moves toward profitability and mainstream adoption, EVERY is making one thing clear: the future of eggs may no longer depend on chickens.
