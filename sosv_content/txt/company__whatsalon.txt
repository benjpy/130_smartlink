WhatSalon is a mobile application that allows you to find and book hair and beauty appointments in your local area at the touch of a button. It uses bespoke to technology to plug into existing salon management tools to check and fill empty time slots.
The user simply selects the date and the service they want to book and if they like, even a particular stylist/therapist too. The app instantly shows them all the available appointments for that day and person. They click “book now” and are charged 10% the cost of the appointment. They then pay 90% directly to the salon.
