Discovering, deciphering, and developing unique plant proteins using synthetic biology
Magellan Life Sciences is a synthetic biology company that discovers and develops plant-inspired proteins for commercial applications in food and beverage industries. The sweet-tasting protein Brazzein (the leading product from our pipeline) holds significant commercial potential as a next-gen protein sweetener that is 1,200 times sweeter than sugar, zero calories, and pH and heat stable. Our XSeed platform is a proprietary synthetic biology-based platform built upon a vast library of proprietary synthetic-secretion signal molecules.
