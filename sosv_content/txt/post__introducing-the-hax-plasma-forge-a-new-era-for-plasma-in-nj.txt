At SOSV, we believe deep tech has the power to unlock world-changing solutions, and that means investing not just in startups, but in the infrastructure, expertise, and ecosystems that support them.
That’s why we’re thrilled to announce the HAX Plasma Forge!
This new facility will be based in the Princeton, NJ area and will be a hub to commercialize plasma technology into real-world products. Think: limitless carbon-free fusion energy, rocket propulsion, fusion supply chain, next-gen AI chips, and more… all powered by plasma.
A Strategic Investment in the Future of Plasma
The HAX Plasma Forge will combine:
- SOSV’s proven model for startup commercialization through HAX, our hard tech program which debuted its Newark, NJ headquarters in 2024 with support from the NJEDA.
- World-class plasma physics expertise and resources from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s premier plasma physics lab.
- Public funding from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) to make it all possible.
Backed by a combined $49 million in funding ($24.5M each from NJEDA and SOSV), the HAX Plasma Forge will include a facility up to 10,000 square feet of lab and co-working space, specially equipped for low-temperature plasma research and offer startups HAX’s signature support model, including:
- Seed capital (up to $550K per startup)
- Hands-on technical support and R&D infrastructure
- Co-location with leading plasma scientists and industry partners
- Access to SOSV’s global founder, investor, and supply chain networks
As NJ Governor Phil Murphy put it:
The NJ HAX Plasma Forge, along with other Strategic Innovation Centers across New Jersey, will support startup creation, generate high-paying jobs, and strengthen the state’s long-term economic competitiveness.
Why Plasma? Why Now?
Plasma is the fourth state of matter, and is emerging as one of the most versatile tools in modern science. Its chemistry is highly efficient, with low activation energy, making it an ideal platform for energy-intensive applications.
At SOSV, we’ve already backed several startups using plasma (check out Yplasma, plasma actuators that generate ionic wind for heating/cooling, and Terra Fusion, centrifugal mirror fusion) and now, with the NJ HAX Plasma Forge, we’re doubling down.
Plasma is a powerful tool in the deep tech arsenal, a technology that unlocks nuclear fusion, powers advanced spacecraft, and manufactures futuristic AI chips. PPPL is a world-renowned leader in this field, and we’re thrilled to partner with them to unlock new possibilities.
From decarbonizing heavy industry to building resilient energy systems, the potential applications of plasma-based tech are massive. But to get there, we need more than just brilliant science… we need to bridge the gap from lab to market. That’s what the Plasma Forge is designed to be. And we’re proud to be leading this effort.
