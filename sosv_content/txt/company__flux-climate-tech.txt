In 2030 property owners will pay $120 billion every year for the electricity consumed by their elevators. Flux’s propulsion tech reduces that consumption by 2/3, saving owners $80B a year.
Elevators are responsible for 0.5% of global emissions and take up to 30% of the space in high buildings. Our tech reduces most of their emissions, abating over 250 million tons of emissions every year.
Ensuring adoption we dramatically improve the ROI of new builds: by reducing the number of elevator shafts needed by up to 50%, we increase the effective available space that can be sold or rented by up to 25%.
