LOTaData, a provider of geospatial intelligence for smarter cities and real-world businesses, recently started analyzing their data for Italy, Spain and the US on a daily basis to understand anonymized people-movement and correlations with COVID-19 patterns. Social interactions and movements are the key drivers for the spread and by providing anonymized and aggregated information about the movement of people, LOTaDATA enables local and regional governments to better monitor the adherence to quarantine policy and helps individuals protect themselves by avoiding crowded areas. Fully GDPR compliant. More on their Data for Humanity program here.
