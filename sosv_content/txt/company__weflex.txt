The fitness industry in China is growing. In one year alone, Chengdu witnessed the growth of 1,000 small to medium-sized fitness studios. Yet, the average studio in China survives less than 5 years because they are run by fitness trainers – excellent at coaching but struggling with managing their business. WeFlex is an Saas+ system to allow studio owners do what they do best, while leaving Weflex to take care of their marketing, customer tracking and analytics, and accounting.
中国的健身行业飞速发展。一年之内，成都近1000家中小型健身工作室拔地而起。但因运营者多为不擅长商业管理的健身教练，中国健身工作室的平均寿命少于5年。Weflex为健身行业从业者提供高效的Saas+管理系统，业务覆盖市场营销、消费者跟踪分析以及财务管理等。
