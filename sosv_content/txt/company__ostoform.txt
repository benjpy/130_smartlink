Ostoform was born from a need to improve skin health for the ostomates who must regularly cope with appliance leaks and the discomfort of damaged peristomal skin. Following several years of speaking with ostomates and understanding their needs in detail, we set out to solve their problems with the Ostoform Mouldable Seal with FLOWASSIST protection.
