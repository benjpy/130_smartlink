SOSV’s pre-seed Hard Tech program HAX has a strong track record with robotics startups, and it came as no surprise that TechCrunch featured four HAX robotics founders at the TechCrunch Sessions: Robotics event last week. The 45-minute panel discussion entitled, Pre-seed to Unicorn: Lessons from HAX Robotics Founders”, covered the experience of robotics founders in very distinct categories, including ship hull cleaning, warehouse management, laboratory automation, commercial cleaning. One lesson: Building robots is hard, and commercial success success means knowing the target market cold.
HAX partner Garrett Winther led the discussion with…
- Kate Ma, COO and Co-founder of Neptune Robotics
- Pramod Ghadge, CEO and Co-founder of UnBoxRobotics
- Chiu Chau, Co-founder of OpenTrons
- Faizan Sheikh, CEO and Co-founder of Avidbots
