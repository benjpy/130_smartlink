Ranomics is building the world’s first comprehensive knowledge base of functionally-characterized genetic variants to help determine their role in disease development and treatment. Even in the absence of established clinical evidence, knowing the impact that a genetic variant has on its protein’s biological function can provide strong evidence to support classification. By determining the functional impact of every missense variant in known disease-causing genes, we’re equipping clinical laboratories and healthcare organizations with the information they need to accurately assess the pathogenicity of novel and rare variants
