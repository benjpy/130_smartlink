There’s no looking away from what 2025 marks for climate tech investing. The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has rolled back much of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and undercut investors’ confidence in many climate tech categories. At the same time, there is no shortage of founders making incredible progress. What they all share is the understanding that their decarbonizing solutions are truly on their own in the marketplace, without any advantage from regulation, subsidies or credits.
Until this year, we described the SOSV Climate Tech Summit in terms of the “emerging” startup ecosystem, but this year we’ve dropped that for “evolving,” because that’s what’s happening. Five years ago, climate founders basked in easy money and benevolent markets; now they wake up daily to an unforgiving landscape. To endure, they have to deliver innovation that outclasses legacy tech and at the same time either decarbonizes the economy or helps humanity adapt to inevitable climate change.
That’s why this year’s SOSV’s Climate Tech Summit (Nov. 3-7 | Virtual | Free | Register) will be our most interesting yet. “Adversity introduces a man to himself,” Albert Einstein once said. And there’s plenty of adversity to drive hard questions and careful introspection about climate tech investing. We’re so grateful to have an incredible line-up of new and returning speakers already confirmed.
