We’re thrilled to announce that FloVision, a startup revolutionizing food production with AI, raised a $8.7 million Series A led by Insight Partners with participation from SOSV’s Ireland Biomanufacturing Fund, Serra Ventures, and Rockstart.
FloVision builds AI-powered tools that combine computer vision hardware and software to help food processors measure yield, monitor quality, and improve labor performance in real time. Their compact sensors attach directly to conveyor belts and workstations, scanning every product that moves through the line. This gives processors unprecedented visibility to detect defects, misgrades, and foreign materials instantly.
Since launching in 2020, FloVision has already processed over 51 million pounds of food and deployed its system in major beef and poultry plants globally, starting with its first corporate customer in Ireland and now expanding across North America, Europe, and Australia. Customers report up to 1.5% more yield, 15x ROI, and significant gains in quality control and staff training, all by reducing waste and enabling faster, data-driven decisions on the production floor.
FloVision was founded by Rian McDonnell and Elise Weimholt, whose combined expertise drives the company’s innovation. McDonnell’s engineering background and upbringing in rural Ireland, where his family worked in beef processing, gave him firsthand insight into protein production challenges:
“I saw firsthand how yield loss and quality inconsistencies impact processors. These experiences shaped my belief that technology could revolutionize an industry that has been slow to innovate,” McDonnell told Tech Business News
With the Series A, FloVision will expand its team of software, hardware, and AI/ML engineers, AI data annotators, and sales representatives in the US and Europe, including Ireland.
At SOSV, we couldn’t be prouder to have supported FloVision from its early days. This funding milestone is not only a win for the team, but a clear signal of the role AI can play in making one of the world’s most essential industries – feeding the world – more efficient, sustainable, and resilient.
