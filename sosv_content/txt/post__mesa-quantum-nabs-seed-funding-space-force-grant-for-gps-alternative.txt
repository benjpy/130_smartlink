The US—and the world—is heavily reliant on fast-aging GPS satellite infrastructure for travel, location mapping, energy grids, and more. GPS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which opens the door to catastrophic outcomes like power grid and telecommunication disruption, failure of military operations in the field and disruptions to supply chain and transportation networks. And what happens if it goes completely dark?
It’s clear we need alternatives. HAX’s Mesa Quantum aims to be the solution. Mesa Quantum is building “chip-scale atomic clocks” and other miniaturized quantum sensors, which can measure and detect changes in the environment around a device to signal where it is in the world, where it needs to go and to keep it in sync with other systems.
Mesa Quantum’s alternative has myriad applications across defense, climate, energy, space, telecommunications and several other key economic areas. Its sensors can ensure clear and steady comms, even via video, regardless of the user’s location. It even works underwater, underground, and in space—locations where GPS has historically been unable to reach.
The company has already caught the eye of the US government, having won a Space Force grant of $1.9M for Alternative PNT(Alt PNT) applications, with several other awards they anticipate in short order as a part of their government scaling.
It also recently announced $3.7M in seed funding led by J2 Ventures, a Boston based fund focused on dual-use technologies, with participation from SOSV. This investment enables Mesa Quantum to build a new research and development facility, hire top technical talent and position themselves to commercialize chip-scale quantum sensors for deployment at scale.
