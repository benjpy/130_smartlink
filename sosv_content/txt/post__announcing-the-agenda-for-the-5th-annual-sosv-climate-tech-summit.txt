We just dropped the agenda for the SOSV Climate Tech Summit and it’s loaded with the investors doubling down on climate and the founders delivering on market share and decarbonization.
In the great words of Warren Buffet, “only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” And our lineup? Fully suited and still swimming strong.
Built for founders, investors, scientists, and policy thinkers who want real answers, not fluff, this year’s live breakout sessions and main stage panels dig into the promise of innovation and the hard work of scaling it.
On the main stage:
You’ll hear from climate’s most seasoned investors — Vinod Khosla, Chris Sacca, Mike Schroepfer, and more — on why they continue to have conviction in climate tech and how deep tech is reshaping the path to decarbonization. Leaders like Jigar Shah (former DOE loans officer) and Kim Zou (CEO of Sightline) will unpack what happens next as IRA incentives fade and global competition heats up.
From the founder frontlines, sessions will explore breakthroughs across energy storage, plasma, fusion, and critical minerals — including Form Energy’s 100-hour batteries, Mainspring Energy’s modular generators, and Quaise Energy’s millimeter-wave geothermal drilling.
Across the live breakout tracks:
You’ll find live AMAs on how to use Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) to drive smarter capital decisions, the practical steps to commercializing first-of-a-kind (FOAK) technologies, how to plan early for that coveted exit, and more.
We’re excited to host this high-engagement forum for climate tech ecosystem of people who are still in the water, pushing through the headwinds. Take a look at the agenda, find the sessions that excite you, and register now (free + virtual):
