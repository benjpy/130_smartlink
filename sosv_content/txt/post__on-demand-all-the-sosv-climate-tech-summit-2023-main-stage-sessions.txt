We just wrapped the SOSV Climate Tech Summit!
We recognize that not everyone could stay in place for 12 hours of panels and firesides over two days, so we worked over time to make each of the main stage sessions available on YouTube. Coordinates below!
Here’s the complete playlist for Day One (Sept. 26) and Day Two (Sept. 27)
