Mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, Zika and malaria infect hundreds of millions every year. Global warming is driving these mosquitoes to spread rapidly, endangering many more.
Diptera.ai’s technology cuts the cost of sterile insect control (SIT) – a natural and highly efficient insect birth control method – to make it a widespread solution against mosquitoes. Diptera.ai combines computer vision and deep biological knowledge to fight mosquitoes and their diseases. Diptera.ai uses non-GMO technology that eliminates the need to build a mosquito rearing and sorting facility near every release site.
