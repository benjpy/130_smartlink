IndieBio New York is hosting its first demo day of the year, on January 24, 2024.
The demo day will feature nine companies fresh out of IndieBio NY’s program (cohort #7) that are working on breakthrough innovations in climate-resilient agriculture, diagnostics, carbon & methane upcycling, cancer therapeutics, and more. You can also check out the list of companies and their descriptions on TechCrunch.
