Jump BIkes (formerly Social Bicycles) is a transportation technology company.
Traditional station-based bikeshare requires a network of kiosks and docking stations. This infrastructure takes up a lot of public space and costs over $5000/bike.
Instead of using ‘smart racks’, Jump Bikes builds ‘smart bikes’. Each bike has an integrated GPS-enabled lock that works with regular bike racks. Our approach eliminates the infrastructure and is 1/5 the cost.
