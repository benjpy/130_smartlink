With their microvortex shedding technology, Indee Labs’ cell engineering platform preserves cell function while boasting high recovery efficiencies and each 5 x 10mm chip can process >50 million cells at >2-4 million cells per second and as low as 100uL in processing volume.
This matters to the population of patients who today cannot afford cell therapy due to the high cost associated with their production. With this system, the ability to engineer T-cells rapidly and more efficiently will make cell therapies more accesible.
