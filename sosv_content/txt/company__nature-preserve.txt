Nature Preserve is a sustainability-centered tech startup. We believe in a world where all agrifood companies can manage to reduce the carbon footprint of their products while delivering profits.
The agrifood system accounts for 1/3 of GHG emissions. The industry is driven by slim margins and is pressured by the governments to reduce emissions. However, the tools for carbon management for agrifood are too complex, unprecise, and often out of budget.
We provide an optimized, precise, and cost-effective web-based SaaS platform for agri-food companies to measure, reduce, report, and communicate climate impact.
