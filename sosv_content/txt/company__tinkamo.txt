Tinkamo is an education technology company that empowers kids with new technologies to discover and reimagine the world.
Tinkamo believe that information technology and artificial intelligence will deeply reform the society. Our kids should be introduced to hands-on coding, computational thinking and gain creative confidence in the early age so they will become creators instead of consumers of technologies for a better future.
With this vision, we started Tinkamo, a company for our digital and AI native kids. Creativity rules.
