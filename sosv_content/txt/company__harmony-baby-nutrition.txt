One in six babies suffer allergies to formula, leading to painful cries and sleepless nights for mother and infant alike. Alternatives such as soy-based formula or hydrolyzed cow’s milk formula are expensive and can also have violent side effects like diarrhea and vomiting.
Harmony Baby Nutrition is a food science-based company that uses precision fermentation to produce human breast milk proteins and create infant formulas that most closely mirror human breast milk. Harmony offers the only dairy-free, allergy-free, and environmentally friendly baby formula in the world.
