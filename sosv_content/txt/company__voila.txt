In China, KOLs and influencers make a lot of money because they drive purchases with social commerce. US influencers make much less because they can only earn on ads and sponsorship. Voilà! brings social commerce to the US fashion industry, enabling fashion micro-influencers to monetize through E-commerce personalized with Voilà!’s visual search engine and product recommendation algorithm. Voilà! has helped over a thousand influencers increase their conversion to sale by 9x driving more than US$15M in sales for over 12,000 brands.
