SOSV’s fourth Climate Tech Summit (Oct. 14-18) is going to be our most intense yet. Investment is down at every stage, and yet phenomenal startups are breaking through in every category, often with huge rounds. All while extreme weather (and political) events sow urgency and uncertainty. All that is making for an incredible agenda, which we will start to reveal soon.
Please register today (free & virtual) to get early heads up on limited attendance breakouts and a monthly update on the program. More than 10,000 people who registered last year, and past speakers on the main stage include Bill Gates, Vinod Khosla, David Kirtley (Helion), Jennifer Holmgren (Lanzatech), Gaurab Chakrabarti (Solugen), Jigar Shah (DoE) and Jesse Jenkins (Princeton).
This year the main stage happens Oct. 16-17, starting at 8 a.m. PT.
New this year: 60-minute, live, Q&A-oriented breakout sessions programmed by some of the top forces in climate tech, including VCs, media experts, and others. The breakouts will be scheduled over the course of Summit week, Oct. 14-18.
And back by popular demand: The VC-Founder Climate Tech Matchup, which last year saw 1,800 VC and founders schedule an incredible 3,500+ meetings. Founders and VCs can pre-register here for the Matchup. The Matchup runs concurrently with the Summit.
