In warehouses around the world, many tasks are still manual—”over 85% of warehouses have almost no automation at all,” according to Masaya Aso, CEO of LexxPluss, in an interview with TechCrunch.
To solve this problem, Aso founded LexxPluss (HAX 2020), a Japan-based startup that designs and develop autonomous mobile robots to transport loads and optimize workflows within warehouses and logistic sites.
With fresh Series A funding to the tune of $10.7M (1.45 billion JPY), LexxPluss is preparing to enter the U.S.—the largest autonomous mobile robots market, which is expected to grow to $3.2 billion by 2028.
The new capital infusion was led by Drone Fund, along with SOSV’s HAX, Incubate Fund, SBI investment and DBJ Capital. The company will also use the funds to increase its payload to 500kg and add a 3D visualization of a “digital twin” for remote control and monitoring.
“LexxPluss has a significant advantage over other warehouse automation companies as they leverage a large technical team in Japan, renowned for both industrial robotics (37% of the global market) and the automotive sector (35% of the U.S. automotive industry),” Duncan Turner, general partner at SOSV and managing director of HAX, told TechCrunch.
“Their technical strength, combined with insight from decades of industry experience, will help them crack the U.S. market where seamless integration is key.”
