Spindle Biotech Inc. is commercializing a proprietary RNA polymerase for large-scale mRNA vaccine production. Recent advances in mRNA technology have shown the growing importance of synthetic RNA in biological systems due to its desirable transient property. Typical mRNA vaccine companies spend up to 60% of their cost of goods on raw materials such as enzymes and DNA templates. Spindle’s platform provides a unique solution in producing high-quality RNA on-demand and in high yield, significantly reducing the cost of goods for mRNA production.
