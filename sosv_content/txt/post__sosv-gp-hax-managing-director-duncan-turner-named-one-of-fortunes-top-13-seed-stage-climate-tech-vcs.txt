SOSV GP & HAX Managing Director Duncan Turner was named one of Fortune’s top 13 seed stage climate tech VCs to watch.
Fortune noted how Turner “uses his design engineering background to help climate tech founders get their product to market—a core skill that can be especially challenging for founders when the market constitutes a huge disruption in infrastructure.”
The article also highlighted how Turner is “investing in innovation that will enable the U.S. to implement sustainable infrastructure and electrification on a large scale: for example, energy storage technology and electrochemistry tech that allows minerals required for electrification to be effectively processed in the U.S. ‘There are two things we’re looking for: groundbreaking technology being leveraged by a founder who has a serious passion for something that’s wrong with the world,'” he said.
