We’re excited to announce the first tranche of breakout sessions at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit. Alongside our main stage programming (full agenda coming soon!), these interactive sessions are designed to dive deeper into the most urgent challenges and opportunities facing climate tech founders, investors, and policymakers.
This year’s lineup highlights practical lessons, founder stories, and emerging categories across the ecosystem – from scaling first-of-a-kind technologies to navigating exits and understanding the risks of oversized capital rounds.
These are just the first of many breakout sessions we’ll be announcing in the weeks ahead.
