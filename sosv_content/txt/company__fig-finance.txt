Fig’s mission is to democratize structured products in the digital age. Our proprietary Collateralized Options Replication Engine (CORE) technology constructs better investment products, faster and cheaper than the human-driven processes at investment banks. We’ve integrated this with a transparent web platform to provide the best experience for investors of all kinds. Fig is currently in private beta and not offering investment products. None of the materials presented on this page shall be interpreted as solicitation, advice, or invitation to buy or sell securities and or investment products.
