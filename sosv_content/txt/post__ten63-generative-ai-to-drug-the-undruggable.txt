At SOSV’s annual general meeting last month, Po Bronson sat down with CEO Marcel Frenkel, PhD, of Ten63 Therapeutics (IndieBio 2019) to discuss the company’s latest milestones and work with AI. Frenkel shared how Ten63’s BEYOND platform “combines physics and AI in hyper-efficient search algorithms” to push the boundaries of computational drug discovery. In short, they find “ideal molecules” that exist “once every trillion times” in a vast chemical space where there are more molecules than stars in the universe.
Putting that into the perspective of real world impact, Frenkel cited a “holy grail” of cancer research—finding a way to tackle the currently undruggable Myc family of cancer genes. “In the last 40 years, there’ve been about a million attempts at inhibiting Myc,” Frenkel said. “Every single one has failed. In about a year, we were able to develop compounds that out-competed anything previously in the world around Myc.”
