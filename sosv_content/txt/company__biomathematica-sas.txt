BioMathematica is building a new standard in the microbiome field: an online platform called DryLab, which processes and integrates microbiome-related “omics” data for condition-specific, personalized microbiome models in healthy and disease states. Using artificial intelligence and genome-scale metabolic modeling, this platform is used by biotech and pharma companies for data analysis and diet-microbiome, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interaction simulations. The platform is dedicated to genomics data analysis and to the development of personalized nutrition, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, and therapeutics design and optimization.
