We’re kicking off something big—SOSV Deep Tech LIVE, our brand-new video podcast series, where we explore the frontiers of Deep Tech with the world’s leading technologists, founders, and researchers.
🔴🎙️🎥 EPISODE 1: “What Now? From the IRA to ‘Drill Baby Drill.’” on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, and wherever else you get fine podcasts.
In our premiere episode, we dive deep into the policies and politics of the energy transition with Dr. Jesse Jenkins, a world-renowned expert in energy systems modeling, grid decarbonization, and U.S. climate policy.
A professor at Princeton University, co-host of Shift Key, and leader of Princeton’s Zero Lab, Dr. Jenkins has been described by Time Magazine as “the scorekeeper for American efforts to transition to clean energy,” and “the wonkiest and most effective of the number crunchers…”
Our moderators are the general partners of SOSV, “The First Check in Deep Tech.” Hosting this episode are Duncan Turner and Katie Hoffman — leaders of HAX, SOSV’s Hard Tech program.
Together with Dr. Jenkins, they unpack some of the most critical questions of our time:
“What did the Biden administration’s climate push really accomplish? We estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act and the infrastructure law are enough to more than double almost triple the rate of decarbonization”
Dr. Jesse Jenkins
He added that the catalytic effects of clean vehicle tax credits alone have led to, “Over $100 Billion of manufacturing investment [and created] about 100,000 jobs that wouldn’t have otherwise been there.”
We also explore:
- How have the Trump administration’s policies already changed everything?
- Where has investment in clean energy created unstoppable momentum, and
- Where could uncertainty and funding freezes send things off the rails?
- How the AI boom is reshaping electricity demand
- Why “drill, baby, drill” could unintentionally spark a geothermal renaissance
- Whether tariffs and trade policies will help or hinder America’s industrial future, and
- How startups can survive and thrive in these uncertain times.
From the bottlenecks stalling clean energy deployment to the hidden power of public utility commissions, this episode is packed with insights for anyone following the high-stakes battle over energy dominance, climate action, and deep tech innovation.
