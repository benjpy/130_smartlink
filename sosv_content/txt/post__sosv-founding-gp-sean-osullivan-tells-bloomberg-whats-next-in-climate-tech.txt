SOSV Founder & Managing General Partner Sean O’Sullivan recently sat down with Bloomberg to discuss his storied career in climate tech and share his vision for the future of the all-important category.
O’Sullivan has “quietly been one of the leading investors in the technology that could redefine what we eat, what we wear, how we get around and — most importantly — how we meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
He explained SOSV’s view that today’s climate tech category goes beyond decarbonization—it encompasses the reinvention of all different means of production. And according to O’Sullivan, “backing climate tech companies is more than good for the planet—it’s also good for investors.”
“Up until now, our gross internal rate of return at SOSV for climate tech companies has outperformed our non climate tech companies,” he told Bloomberg. “It is in the range of around 50% over the course of eight years from 2015 to 2022. It’s in the top decile of venture capital returns.”
