Powering the energy transition with next-generation cathode materials
The U.S. lithium-ion battery industry is at a critical inflection point. More than 90% of cathode materials are produced in Asia—creating a massive cost and security gap in U.S. battery production.
Nascent’s mission is to close that gap. We develop and scale advanced manufacturing technologies that:
•Reduce dependence on imports
•Lower production costs
•Accelerate the commercialization of next-generation cathode chemistries
•Domestic manufacturing to support US energy storage value chains
We are not just building materials—we are building independence.
