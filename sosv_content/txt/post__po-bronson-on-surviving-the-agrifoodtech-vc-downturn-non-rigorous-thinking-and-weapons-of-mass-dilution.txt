“Some startups pitch us, and it’s a terrible pitch, but I don’t just ignore those people,” says Po Bronson, general partner at SOSV. “I have to listen, hunt among the crumbs, and find founders no one’s going to invest in, but who are actually doing something amazing.”
In a new AgFunderNews interview, Po shares how great companies are still getting funded (despite the market downturn) and why “VC is the most expensive capital in the world.” He urges founders to look beyond venture to private wealth, corporates, and governments as the next wave of smart capital.
Po also digs into low-capex biomanufacturing, AI in agrifood, and how corporates and governments will play a growing role in shaping deep tech innovation.
