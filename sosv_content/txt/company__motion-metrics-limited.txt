Using digital coaching to redefine how physical activities are taught
Motion Metrics Limited creates hardware and software to teach you how to perform and improve during physical activity. They sell the world’s first digital ski coach, which gives users access to detailed analysis of their skiing performance based on motion-sensing inserts placed in the boot and connected to the user’s smartphone with Bluetooth.
