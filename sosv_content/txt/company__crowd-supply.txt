Crowd Supply lets you raise money from the crowd to manufacture your next big idea. Their mission is to bring original and useful hardware to life by helping creators launch with the funding and support they need to deliver thoughtfully crafted products to delighted backers.
Once funded, continue taking pre-orders until it’s manufactured. Once manufactured, continue selling it from Crowd Supply’s warehouses. Shipping and logistics are taken care of and they’ll point you in the right direction if you need help along the way.
