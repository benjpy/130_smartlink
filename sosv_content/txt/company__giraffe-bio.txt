The global transition to net-zero emissions hinges on the mining of critical minerals, yet copper and lithium production, projected to grow 30% and 465% by 2050, will still fall short of meeting demand. Mining faces daunting challenges: 70% of copper remains locked in low-grade ores, and extracting it is increasingly uneconomical due to the massive amounts of water, energy, and chemicals required. Moreover, developing one new mine can take over a decade and billions of dollars, leaving a widening gap between supply and demand.
Giraffe Bio, a Latin America-based company, is revolutionizing mining through the development of cell-free biomolecules that bind to specific metals in low-grade ores and tailings, enabling their extraction with unprecedented efficiency and sustainability. These biomolecules are custom-engineered to target each mine’s unique geological profile, delivering unmatched selectivity, higher yields, and faster processing times while significantly reducing energy, water, and chemical consumption.
Giraffe’s technology has boosted copper recovery in flotation processes by 20% during lab tests and reduced lithium extraction times from months to hours. With plans to expand into nickel, gallium, and rare earth metals, Giraffe Bio is turning mining’s toughest challenges into opportunities, unlocking value from waste streams and enhancing sustainability. Led by Alejandro Buffo Sempé and Juan Pablo Fernandez, PhD, Giraffe Bio brings together expertise in commodities, genomic and biochemical innovation, and sustainable technologies. The company’s mission is to help the mining industry meet the world’s energy transition needs while safeguarding our planet.
