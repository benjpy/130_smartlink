Biological sample preparation has not kept pace with the dramatic changes in analytical techniques. Nowhere is this more evident than in DNA sample prep, which continues to be a low throughput process serving high throughput next-generation DNA sequencing. This mismatch is limiting the accelerated uptake of next generation sequencing.
Inso Bio envisions a future of increased accessibility, where complex sample prep protocols are completed from start to finish with the push of a button. This is why we are developing next-generation platforms to streamline workflows leading up to sequencing, to give people more time to devote to science, discovery, and data, rather than wrestling with their samples.
