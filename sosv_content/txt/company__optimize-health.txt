Optimize.Health (formerly known as Pillsy) makes life easier for the two-thirds of Americans who take pills and their families. The PillsyCap seamlessly tracks when you take pills and talks to our mobile app, which sends smart reminders when you forget. We also provide access to important information about drug and vitamin products, including pricing, symptom tracking, and the ability to refill within the app.
