Zurich-based Oxyle recently raised a $16M seed round led by 360 Ventures with participation from Axeleo Capital, Founderful and SOSV, according to a report in Forbes.
Water supplies around the world are contaminated with “Forever Chemicals,” or the 10,000 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances known by the acronym PFAS. They are linked to a sharp increases in certain cancers and other human and animal health problems. Current effort to remove them often involve creating new, problematic waste streams or require very high energy.
Oxyle’s founders, Fajer Mushtaq and Silvan Staufert, both PhDs at the scientific university ETH Zurich, have developed a material and process that completely breaks down PFAS into harmless materials with no by-product or enormous energy demands. Their first commercial prototype is working in Switzerland and processing 10 cubic meters of water per hour. In trials with ground water, Oxyle’s technology reduces PFAS concentrations from 8,700 ng/l to below 14 ng/l.
From Forbes: “Unlike traditional methods that merely contain these harmful chemicals, Oxyle’s solution destroys them permanently, setting a new standard for tackling this urgent environmental crisis,” says Thomas Nivard, a partner at 360 Capital. “This is a game changer; the team’s exceptional commercial and technical momentum has laid a strong foundation for establishing a true technology leader in the coming years.”
