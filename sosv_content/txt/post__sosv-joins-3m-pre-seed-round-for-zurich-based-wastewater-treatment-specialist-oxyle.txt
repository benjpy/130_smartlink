ETH Zurich spinout Oxyle is one step closer to bringing its wastewater treatment technology to market, according to TechCrunch: “Oxyle’s tech uses water movement to remove pollutants”.
In a pre-seed funding round led by Wingman Ventures, Oxyle raised $3M, bringing the company’s total capital raised since its 2020 founding to $7.4M. SOSV, Better Ventures, and another.vc joined the round.
During her doctoral research at ETH Zurich, Oxyle co-founder and CEO Dr. Fajer Mushtaq often worked with synthetic materials that resulted in toxic wastewater requiring special handling and disposal. The process of removing chemicals from the wastewater was so ineffective that the wastewater was often incinerated.
Enter Oxyle. The company has developed smart catalysts that converts various energy sources (e.g. light, vibrations, flow and stress) from wastewater into chemical reactions. These chemical reactions oxidize, destroy, and mineralize toxic micropollutants into harmless byproducts. The company uses modular reactors to deploy its technology and offers an analytics platform for clients to monitor micropollutants in real time.
Dr. Mushtaq highlights the importance of Oxyle’s technology: “We are living in an era where we face several existential crises on a daily basis and lack of clean, pollutant-free water is one of them. At Oxyle, we are bringing market-disruptive solutions that remove and detect micropollutants in an efficient, cost-effective and sustainable manner for our industrial and municipal customers.”
With this new funding, the company will expand its customer portfolio into additional segments, ramp up partnerships to enter new markets, upscale and strengthen its team, and—most importantly—bring its first product to market next year.
