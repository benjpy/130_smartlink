Lula Commerce, an SOSV portfolio company and AI-powered digital commerce platform for retailers, was recently featured in the Philadelphia Business Journal following its $8M Series A round led by SEMCAP AI, with participation from Rich Products Ventures, GO PA Fund, NZVC, UP.Partners, Green Circle Foodtech Ventures, and Outlander VC.
Despite more than 155,000 convenience stores serving 160 million Americans daily, fewer than 10% offer online ordering or delivery. Lula is changing that with an AI-powered operating system designed specifically for convenience retailers.
The company’s suite of products includes:
- Lula Hub: A unified dashboard integrating Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub.
- Lula Direct: Tools for branded web and mobile ordering.
- Lula Operators: A suite of 30+ AI tools automating refunds, reviews, uptime, and more.
By simplifying complex operations and connecting fragmented systems, Lula enables retailers to operate with the same digital sophistication as global giants without the massive tech budgets.
Lula’s technology is already in use across major retail groups including Circle K (franchisees), United Pacific (Rocket/Alta Stores), Jacksons Food Stores, Par Mar Stores, and Clipper Petroleum, among others, representing thousands of stores nationwide.
