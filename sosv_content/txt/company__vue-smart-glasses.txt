Vue is the world’s first pair of smart glasses that are designed for everyday use. Vue’s frames are packed with technology hidden inside regular-looking frames. With Vue, you can listen to music via bone conduction, track fitness activity, talk to voice assistants such as Alexa or Siri, or get notifications from your phone. Vue comes with prescription lenses included, and is also offered in sunglasses.
