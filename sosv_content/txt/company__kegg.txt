kegg leverages the power of AI and the world’s largest dataset on vaginal health to revolutionize women’s healthcare. Less than 2% of the healthcare industry focuses on women-specific issues, which is why kegg is driving change by delivering unparalleled insights into fertility, postpartum vaginal infections, pelvic floor disorders, polycystic ovaries, and perimenopause. kegg’s flagship wearable and the 24,000 women who use it create a unique and defensible data set and provide women with a product to manage their reproductive health in entirely new ways.
