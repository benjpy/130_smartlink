Marketing and commerce platform where buyers voluntarily participate in brand marketing
StyleSeller is a marketing plus commerce platform in which buyers voluntarily participate in brand marketing, so the products of the company spread out simultaneously. At the same time, buyers can create new value (revenue) from their purchased product. We create a zero-marketing market through linking buyers and brands.
