We’re thrilled to announce that Samphire Neuroscience, a graduate of our HAX hard tech startup development program, has secured $5 million Seed round led by Inventure VC with participation from Fortify Ventures.
Earlier this year, the company launched Nettle—a CE-certified, non-hormonal neurotechnology device designed to relieve mental and physical symptoms tied to menstruation. Using gentle transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), Nettle targets brain regions linked to mood and pain. Worn like a headband for 20 minutes a day in the days leading up to a period, the device offers a side effect–free alternative to traditional treatments.
Since its European debut, Nettle has sold out twice and seen especially strong demand from people with PMDD. Clinical data shows symptom relief—including reduced pain, mood swings, and brain fog—in just one month.
Founded in 2021, Samphire’s team includes CEO Emilė Radytė (PhD in Neurosciences and Neurobiology) and COO Alex Cook, Samphire is tackling a massive unmet need, aiming to support the 190 million people globally living with chronic menstrual conditions.
You can find Nettle now available via their website and select clinics.
