CroíValve is developing a transcatheter device to treat Tricuspid Regurgitation, a common heart valve disorder for which there are no commercially-available, minimally-invasive solutions. CroíValve’s solution, invented by a leading interventional cardiologist, is a coaptation valve to restore tricuspid valve function by supporting the native valve leaflets. It is held in place by an atraumatic anchor that facilitates straightforward delivery and positioning while also preserving the cardiac anatomy.
