BiomeSense, a SOSV portfolio company and IndieBio graduate, announced a $7M oversubscribed round, led by Bluestein Ventures with participation from Labcorp Venture Fund, Emil Capital, Shorewind Capital, and OceanM19.
This new investment accelerates their mission to build the first AI-powered intelligence platform for the gut microbiome — integrating their GutLab “smart bathroom” technology with the MetaBiome AI bioinformatics platform to enable continuous, standardized microbiome monitoring and analysis.
Together, these tools are unlocking a new generation of microbiome-driven biomarkers and applications across precision medicine, nutrition, and consumer health.
Congrats to Founder and CEO Kevin Honaker and the entire BiomeSense team!
