In a challenging funding climate with total deal flow and valuation down, IndieBio has continued to invest aggressively in deep tech that is paving the way for a healthier future—both for humanity and the planet. As a result of this strategy, we’re excited to announce that both of SOSV’s IndieBio programs debuted their latest cohorts. Be one of the first to catch the new batches:
- IndieBio San Francisco Batch 14 features incredible teams in spaces like carbon capture and removal, drug discovery, biodegradable textiles, and functional nutrition.
- IndieBio New York Batch 06—the first in the new NY HQ at 7 Penn Plaza in NYC—includes founders across sustainable agriculture, cell-based immunotherapy, therapeutics, and bioreactors.
P.S. We are looking for the next generation of early-stage founders working in tech with applications for planetary and human health. If you have a revolutionary idea, please submit an application, and someone from our team will reach out for an interview (or more, if we really like you and your idea).
