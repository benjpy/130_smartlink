Microgenesis has worked with some of the hardest infertility cases there are – women who have undergone and failed multiple rounds of IVF. With a cohort of 287 would-be mothers, over 75% of their patients became pregnant using their proprietary test and nutraceutical regimen. Microgenesis uses microRNA signatures, on swabs from the fertility biome, to diagnose 64 phenotypes. They treat patients with 53 combinations of probiotics, nutraceuticals and diet-change. With personalized nutraceuticals and probiotics it resets fertility in 90 days.
