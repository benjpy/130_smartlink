Rampant inflation, fuel shortages and the pandemic have ravaged developing economies, causing billions of low-income workers to lose their jobs and see their incomes fall to less than $0.80 an hour.
We are Morfyus, a job platform where workers can find new earning opportunities in the Web3 economy by playing games, building communities, collecting data or creating content.
We provide workers with free tools and training to start earning in a matter of hours and give employers access to the new Web3 economy labor force they need.
Over the last 10 months we grew our worker base 10x, our workers doubled their average income, and our revenue has grown to almost $150K/mo. growing 20% per month.
