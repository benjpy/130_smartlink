The third annual SOSV Climate Tech Summit is coming on Sept. 26-27, and we want to see you there. The event is virtual and free. You can register here.
If you register early, and you are a climate VC or founder, we have a special offer.
You will get an early invitation to register for our invitation-only, limited-capacity VC-Founder Climate Matchup, which we run in conjunction with the Summit. Last year, participants took more than 1500 meetings and were delighted with the networking. Participation is free, but we will invite only folks who are qualified and registered for the Summit. So save your spot now!
The Climate Summit is where startups and VCs convene to learn from the top investors and founders in the fast emerging climate tech category. Past amazing speakers include Bill Gates (Breakthrough), Chris Sacca (Lowercarbon Capital), Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures), Katie Rae (The Engine), Jennifer Holmgren (LanzaTech), David Kirtley (Helion), and Tony Fadell (Future Shape).
Stay tuned for this year’s updates!
