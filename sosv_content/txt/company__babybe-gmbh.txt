BABYBE is a bionic mattress that keeps mothers and their babies connected through the process of artificial incubation. We bring haptic information from the mother to the baby in real-time, making the environment inside the incubator machine less stressful while giving the mother an active role in the care of her pre-term infant. We do this by collecting the mother´s body signs like heart beat, breathing, and voice through a device installed against her chest and translating those signals into movement on a Bionic Mattress that emulates the mother’s chest in all of its nuances.
