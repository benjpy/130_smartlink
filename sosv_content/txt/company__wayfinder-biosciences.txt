Get In Touch with Wayfinder Biosciences
Please tell us a little bit about yourself and why you'd like to get connected. Wayfinder Biosciences + SOSV will follow up with you via email.
Wayfinder has built a drug discovery platform for small molecules that modulate RNA targets. Their technology generates highly quantitative data on RNA-small molecules interactions at high-throughput. Combined with their AI/ML virtual screening models, they can search billions of molecules for RNA modulators in just 3 days.
And they do it way faster than anyone else in the world. Wayfinder is WAY faster.
A spinout from the Center for Synthetic Biology at the University of Washington, Wayfinder has internal programs in oncology and unique technologies to unlock RNA drugging.
