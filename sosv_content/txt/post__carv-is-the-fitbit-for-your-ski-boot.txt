The TechCrunch article “Is that a ski coach in your boot, or are you just happy to see me?” highlights Carv, a ski-performance wearable that analyzes skiers’ technique and coaches them with live audio as they ski. Carv’s platform includes an insert that fits the liner of any ski boot to measure and analyze technique. Data from the hardware device transmits to an app, where a real-time audio coach can provide a personalized training plan.
TechCrunch reports that Carv raised $5.1M to complete a series A round spearheaded by games-industry venture capital firm Hiro Capital. This funding adds to investments from SOSV and Artesian VC, bringing Carv’s total funding to $10.9 million.
“Our mission at Carv is to make ski coaching both more enjoyable and accessible through gamification,” co-founder and CEO Jamie Grant told TechCrunch. “[Lead investor] Hiro’s wealth of gaming experience and its positive application in sports makes them the perfect partner in helping us achieve this vision.”
