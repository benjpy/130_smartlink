QV Bioelectronics is developing an implanted electrotherapy device for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is the most most common primary adult brain cancer, and with no cure and limited treatments available, patients are only expected to survive 14 months post-diagnosis. Our innovative electrode technology will allow us to double the life expectancy of patients by delivering electrotherapeutic currents 24/7 without impacting a patient’s quality of life.
