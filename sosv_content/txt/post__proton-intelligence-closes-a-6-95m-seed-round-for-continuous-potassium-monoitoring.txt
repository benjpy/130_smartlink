Potassium imbalances can be life-threatening, especially for those with chronic kidney disease (estimated to be 10% of the population worldwide) or at risk of heart failure. Proton Intelligence has raised a $6.95M seed round to accelerate their work on a continuous potassium monitor that aims revolutionize clinical care for at risk patients. Participants in the round included SOSV, We Venture Capital (Werfen), Tenmile, LongeVC, 15th Rock, Exor, and Trampoline Venture Partners.
Founded by Sahan Ranamukhaarachchi and Victor Cadarso, who bring a decade of expertise in wearable biosensors, Canada-based Proton Intelligence is preparing for human trials and the goal is to bring the product to market in 2027. (Not 2025, as mistakenly reported in TechCrunch.)
“We are proud to be the first institutional investor in Proton Intelligence,” said Mohan S. Iyer, General Partner at SOSV, “and we are excited to continue to support them as they move into clinical validation.” SOSV invested at pre-seed as well as the new seed round, and Proton Intelligence is an alum of SOSV’s IndieBio SF deep tech program.
