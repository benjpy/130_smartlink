Haptic is a wearable haptics design company developing products that communicate information entirely via touch. By utilizing the skin as a non-intrusive communication channel, their vibration-based language creates new possibilities for information communication. Haptic’s first products are employed with a haptic corridor and a non-visual interface, creating independence for the blind and visually impaired as they easily and effectively navigate the world around them.
