Meat alts at parity with animal meat and a 73% margin due to ingredient innovation
What’s the ingredient innovation?- We find a better home for nutrients from industrial food and beverage sidestreams. This allows to earn on every pound, selling on par with animal meat when others lose. FDA-compliant. Patented. The pilot facility proved COGS and CapEx. Featured on the cover of Alt Meat Magazine, COP 28 and TechCrunch. Supply secured via strategic partnership and investment from AB InBev.
