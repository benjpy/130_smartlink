The world of industrial materials needs to be reinvented in ways that eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Batteries, cement, steel, ammonia and may others must get on a sustainable path.
No one has done more to bring science and commerce together to address that challenge than Dr. Yet-Ming Chiang, an MIT engineering and materials science professor, prolific researcher, and co-founder of two climate tech unicorns, Form Energy (long-duration energy storage, raised $368.8M) and Desktop Metal (metal 3D printing, raised $811.8M), as well as several other climate startups.
We very much enjoyed interviewing Dr. Chiang at the SOSV Climate Tech Summit on October 25-26. We discussed what Dr. Chiang has learned in the course of turning new deeptech from the lab into promising startups, what he sees as “white spaces” in climate tech, and what advances are shaking up the world of materials science today. Check out the video of the session below.
Dr. Chiang leads the newly established MIT Climate Grand Challenge project Center for electrification and decarbonization of industry, which is unifying climate efforts across MIT in order to get the most promising projects to full commercialization within five years. He also as well as co-founded rising stars and notables Sublime Systems (decarbonizing cement and concrete), 24M Technologies (energy storage systems for grid and transportation applications), A123 Systems (automotive lithium-ion solutions) and American Superconductor Corporation (AMSC, grid-wide power electronics and superconductor systems).
Dr. Chiang has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed publications and obtained 100 patents.
Benjamin Joffe, Partner at SOSV and co-curator of the Summit, interviewed Dr. Chiang. Please check out the recorded session with one of the world’s most remarkable climate technologists.
