We turn internal combustion engines into powerful tools for decarbonization.
Blaze Energy transforms existing engines to run on zero- or low-carbon fuels like ammonia, with minimal retrofitting. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption of alternative fuels and offer a low-risk, cost-effective path to decarbonization.
