We have just published the Agenda for the main stage of our fourth annual SOSV Climate Tech Summit. There are 17 main stage programming sessions on Oct. 16 and 17 that cover climate tech challenges, such as the investment slow down; emerging categories, including geologic hydrogen and solar engineering; and well established sectors, including batteries, steel and cement.
If you haven’t already, we hope you will register today. The Summit is free, online and takes place over Oct. 14-18.
The goal of the Summit is to help the people at heart of the climate tech ecosystem – the founders, investors, corporates, researchers, and policy makers – learn from each other and establish new connections. Last year over 5,000 people participated, making the Summit the largest tech gathering focused on climate. Despite the huge audience, the Summit is also designed to connect founders and investors 1:1 based on their interests.
The Summit has three parts:
The Main Stage
Oct. 16-17, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. PT. Here is where we host the fireside chats and small panel discussions with top founders and investors, moderated by leading climate journalists and other experts. We just announced the main stage agenda, which currently lists 17 sessions.
Register here for regular agenda updates and access to the main stage programming.
The Breakouts
Oct. 14-18. These live, Zoom Sessions are organized by SOSV’s Summit partners, and they provide founders and others an interactive forum where they can learn from investors and other founders. Each breakout has its own registration in Zoom.
The breakouts are listed below, each with its own registration link; the same information is on the Summit’s agenda page.
The VC-Founder Matchup
Oct. 14 – 18 We invite qualified climate founders and venture investors to join this unique matchmaking event, which last year involved over 500 investors and 500 founders, generating over 2,000, introductory meetings matched based on the stage, location, and other qualifiers. The Matchup has its own registration, separate from the main stage and the breakout registrations. The platform opens to meeting requests September 30.
