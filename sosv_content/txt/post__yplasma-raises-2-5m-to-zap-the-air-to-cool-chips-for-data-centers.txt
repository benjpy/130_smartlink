The AI era has brought unprecedented computational power…and with it, unprecedented heat. As chips grow denser and data centers swell, conventional cooling systems are hitting their limits.
That’s why we’re excited to unveil our portfolio company YPlasma, which recently announced a $2.5M seed round led by Faber, with participation from SOSV to commercialize its solid-state plasma actuator technology – a compact, silent, and energy-efficient alternative to traditional fans and liquid cooling systems.
With R&D facilities in both HAX’s Newark, NJ location and in Madrid, Spain, the company is a spin-out from INTA, the Spanish Space Agency, and an early partner of the Mobile World Capital Barcelona Foundation.
YPlasma’s unique plasma actuators generate ionic wind to move heat away from critical components without any moving parts. The result is a fundamentally new approach to thermal management and flow control in high-performance electronics and the semiconductor industry.
The first commercial integration is expected later this year in consumer electronics, including laptops and similar devices. But the potential doesn’t stop there. YPlasma’s plasma actuator platform has a wide range of high-impact applications across different industries beyond electronics, including:
- Influence aerodynamics increasing wind power generation or reducing aircraft fuel consumption
- Generate propulsion using atmospheric gases as propellant for VLEO satellites or drones
- Disinfect surfaces in controlled environments like vertical farms
- Activate media to alter material properties producing plasma activated water with better cooling capacity
YPlasma was founded in 2023 by David García, a serial entrepreneur with a background in energy efficiency and holds an MBA and a degree in Industrial Engineering from the Barcelona School of Industrial Engineering, and previously co-founded multiple ventures bridging industrial science and real-world impact. With YPlasma, he’s turning space-grade physics into a platform for next-gen cooling and beyond.
