Flair (HAX 06), a startup that produces smart HVAC vents for residential homes, recently raised $7.6 million in a series A, according to TechCrunch in “Smart vent startup Flair nabs $7.6M Series A to decarbonize buildings”.
The funding was led by Active Impact Investments and Lowercarbon Capital with support from previous investors SOSV, Skyview, and Resilience Capital Partners. New investors Susquehanna Foundation, Shell Ventures, and 3M Ventures also participated in the round.
Flair’s temperature sensor called a “Puck” syncs with the company’s smart vents to open and close once a room reaches a set temperature, improving homeowner comfort and reducing energy consumption. Flair’s software can target only occupied rooms, and homeowners can set temperature thresholds for individual rooms, TechCrunch reported.
Speaking about the impact of the series A, Flair CEO Dan Myers told TechCrunch: “This investment represents a clear conviction about the urgency of reducing the impact of buildings and is a recognition of the criticality of both software and hardware solutions needed to transition to a clean energy future.”
