IndieBio San Francisco’s VC-Founder Meetings will be held March 17-20th and our Demo Day is on Friday March 21st, 2025.
Due to overwhelming demand for meetings last year, we’re encouraging investors to start meeting our companies ahead of Demo Day.
We have 8 new companies + 3 alumni companies who we’re excited to feature. See the names and information on the companies below.
For those in the SF Bay area, you can book in person meetings at our offices from March 17-20th before they go global on Friday. Every afternoon of that week we’ll be hosting a happy hour.
If you’re NOT local to the Bay Area, please sign up for the “Virtual” Demo Day on March 21st and we’ll make sure you get the investor portal link. Registered investors will be able to review each company’s pitch video and deck, as well as request appointments with founders.
For any questions, please contact us at events@sosv.com
