Layer 2 protocol (rollups) delivering EVM capabilities to non-EVM blockchains
Milkomeda offers a novel protocol that empowers several leading blockchains (Algorand, Terra, Solana, and Cardano) with EVM support and a path for long-term scaling via a rollup composability layer. We deliver rollup technologies to leading Layer 1 ecosystems by offering the most popular smart contracting language, Solidity, while enhancing inter-blockchain interoperability, user experience, and developer traction—all at the Layer 2 level.
