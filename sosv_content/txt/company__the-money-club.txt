A safe and secure mobile platform for P2P chit fund based savings in India
The Money Club is the first mobile app in India that enables users to form closed, trusted communities to save, borrow, and invest with each other at better rates than banks. Pool money regularly with verified users and withdraw up to 10 times more money than you have saved—particularly during times of crisis.
