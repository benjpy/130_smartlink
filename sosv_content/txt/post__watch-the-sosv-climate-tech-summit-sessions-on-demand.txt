We hosted the fourth SOSV Climate Tech Summit and the VC-Founder Climate Matchup over Oct. 14-18. So far, about 10,000 people have participated by watching the main stage interviews, joining in the live breakout sessions, engaging in VC-founder pitches, or watching session replays on YouTube. Our goal at the summit is to deepen the ecosystem around climate tech, and it’s safe to say we nudged things in the right direction! Below is a list of the main stage sessions and breakouts, with links to the videos on YouTube. If you would like to view more detail for each session, including the speakers, you can find that on the agenda at the summit website.
