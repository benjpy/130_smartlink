ZymoChem (IndieBio) landed $21M from investors led by Breakout Ventures along with Toyota Ventures, lululemon, GS Ventures and SOSV. The company’s bio-based polymers have wide-ranging applications from textiles to automotive.
ZymoChem converts renewable feedstocks into a variety of high-performance, bio-based, biodegradable polymers with near-zero CO2 emissions. The proprietary fermentation process improves yields by up to 50% versus alternative processes creating a dramatic cost advantage.
“We’re upending the materials industry,” said Harshal Chokhawala, co-founder and CEO. “Our technology delivers sustainability without compromising performance, scale, and importantly economics. This unlock already catalyzed multiple partnerships with world-leading companies and we’re thrilled to expand our impact with our key stakeholders.”
This round comes after a recent $4M grant from the Department of Energy, which ZymoChem will leverage to launch its first high-performance material and advance its first partnered product to commercial scale.
