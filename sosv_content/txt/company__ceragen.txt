In a time when extreme climate makes crop harvests uncertain, greenhouses offer consistent yields while using fewer water and land resources. Ceragen contributes to the sustainable intensification of crop production with a single application of their ACCelerate probiotic, which increases hydroponic tomato yields up to 16% in field trials. Ceragen’s microbial discovery platform has a pipeline of additional products, with a lettuce product expected in Q3 2022.
