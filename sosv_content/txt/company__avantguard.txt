The future of long-term pathogen protection with cutting-edge antimicrobial solutions
15 minutes after cleaning a surface with bleach, the bleach disappears, and a surface can be recolonized by nearby microorganisms. Now ask yourself: how often are surfaces cleaned with disinfectants?
AvantGuard’s technology acts as a bleach extending agent. Their first product, HaloFilm™, is a simple spray that creates a thin-layer film to hold bleach molecules close to the surface. The film is safe to human touch and can be “recharged” with fresh bleach applications to maintain disinfection. HaloFilm™ extends surface disinfection against fungi, bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
