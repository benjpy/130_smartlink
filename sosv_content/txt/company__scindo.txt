Every year, 8 million tons of plastic end up in the oceans, while only 9% of plastic in the US is recycled. Current recycling methodologies have been unable to break down some of the most commonly produced plastics.
Scindo can recycle the unrecyclable. They are creating a novel biological platform for low-energy, green and economical recycling that turns low-value plastic waste into high-value compounds that can be used in a variety of industries. Specifically, they target some of the most-produced plastics globally that currently cannot be efficiently recycled, so we can put an end to plastics in landfills.
