The Robot Report recently spotlighted SOSV’s Robotics Matchup, our newest virtual event designed to connect early-stage robotics startups with investors who are actively deploying capital today. After years of running matchups across climate, health, and industrial tech, we’ve found that founders don’t need another demo day…they need high-signal, curated conversations with investors who actually want to meet them.
The Robotics Matchup is fully online and structured around curated 1:1 meetings. Each founder–investor meeting lasts 20 minutes. If both sides want to continue, they schedule follow-ups independently.
“It’s very difficult for founders to know who’s interested in robotics. If you look at existing databases like PitchBook and CrunchBase, you have a picture of the past, but you don’t really know who wants to invest in robotics today,” Ben Joffe, senior partner at SOSV said. “Even if you find a firm name, you don’t necessarily have the name of an individual you can reach out to. This platform saves founders many, many hours of research.”
When signing up for the Robotics Matchup, investors define their criteria — stage, geography, verticals, robotics categories, check size, and hardware vs. software focus — while founders provide corresponding details about their technology and traction. Founders can filter investors by sector and check size, while investors can review startups before accepting a meeting, ensuring booked conversations reflect genuine interest.
“There are some great in-person events, but they tend to be a bit pricey,” Joffe said. “We didn’t find anything online that was comparable to what we wanted to do. So this is an event with no talks—just a pure networking and matchmaking platform to help founders in the categories we cover connect with potential investors.”
