At BioCraft, we recognize the nutritional value of meat for pets. But traditional meat production comes with some devastating consequences, including climate change, animal cruelty and risks to public health. For those reasons, we are making cultivated meat to replace traditional slaughtered-animal meat for pet food.
BioCraft is a B2B biotechnology company creating cultivated meat slurry for pet food. BioCraft’s meat slurry is a combination of cell biomass and essential nutrients, optimized for cats and dogs, at a fraction of the cost of standard cultivated meat.
