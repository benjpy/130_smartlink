Get In Touch with CellCrine
Please tell us a little bit about yourself and why you'd like to get connected. CellCrine + SOSV will follow up with you via email.
CellCrine discovered an enzyme that transforms cell culture for the cell-based meats industry.
It’s made recombinantly, but can be used at such low concentration that only a tiny bit is needed.
The impact is dramatic — reducing the need for insulin, transferrin, FGF2, TGFb, and other expensive media ingredients. The cells grow nearly as fast as they do en vivo.
CellCrine’s enzyme works by stimulating cells to make their own growth factors; it also chaperones growth factors to receptors. With muscle cells, they also help myotube formation.
The enzyme is food grade and natural.
