Last Inch Assessment (LIA) Technology from LEADOPTIK is transforming real-time depth imaging and bridging the gap between diagnosis and therapy for early-stage lung cancer. LIA features an AI-powered imaging console and a single-use, image-guided biopsy needle. Its metasurface optics – 100 times thinner than a human hair – deliver 50 times higher resolution than legacy technologies. By enabling real-time differentiation between malignant and benign tissue, LIA empowers physicians to achieve precise diagnosis (during biopsy) and effective therapy (targeting cancerous areas for ablation or surgical resection).
