The RNA Architects - Computer-guided mRNA/RNA TX/VX design & RNA-based DX
We provide computational mRNA/RNA design services for the industry and academia to help develop more stable mRNA vaccines and more effective RNA-based drugs, reposition RNA-targeted drugs and develop more accurate diagnostics methods. We have developed a novel diagnostics technology that enables the detection of a myriad of pathologies in a fast, cost-efficient and easy-to-use manner by detecting RNA biomarkers.
