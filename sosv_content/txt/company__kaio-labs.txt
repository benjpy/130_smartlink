Get In Touch with Kaio Labs
Please tell us a little bit about yourself and why you'd like to get connected. Kaio Labs + SOSV will follow up with you via email.
Kaio Labs develops carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion technologies that enable point-source conversion of waste emissions into value-added chemicals. Through integrated system-level optimization we develop electrolyzers with high selectivity and energy efficiency to convert CO2 into products like carbon monoxide, formic acid, and ethylene at cost-competitive prices.
Using an AI-driven workflow which combines automated experimentation and probabilistic machine learning, our electrolyzer systems are co-optimized across catalysts, device architecture, and operational parameters to achieve industrial-scale performance requirements at the highest performance from day one.
