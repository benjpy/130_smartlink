Microendo is the first supplier and developer specialized in biofertilizers for specific crops. We use the plant’s Microbiota for product development. The Microbiota are the communities of microorganisms that live inside and outside the plant. In this way we offer an organic and crop-specific product that provides better results than a common biofertilizers, gives health to the plants, reducing chemical fertilizer by up to 70%, increasing yields by up to 30, sequestering CO2 in the soil and at the same time recovers the original Microbiota of the crops.
