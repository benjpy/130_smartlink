Despite its increasing popularity in medicine, cannabis is too costly to produce at a large scale with the quality and consistency needed for medical use. Instead of depending on the cannabis plant and breeding new strains, we use engineered yeast to produce the same products, including THC, CBD, and even many of the minor cannabinoids, which are only found in small quantities in the plant. Compared to plants, our process is exponentially cheaper and faster while also giving patients, doctors, and researchers the quality they can depend on.
